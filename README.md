### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Jonathan!

I'm interested in programming languages, particularly regarding techniques, methods, and tools to make it easier for people to program, and to program correctly. I enjoy work related to type systems, static analysis techniques, and compiler optimizations. 

 - ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently reading through and doing the exercises on lattices in Chapter 4 of Static Program Analysis. 
 - ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the basics of formal verification by working through Volume I of Software Foundations.
 - ðŸ”­ I'm trying to find time to learn about algebraic handlers and effects. 
 - ðŸ”­ I'd like to gain a better intuition about fixed points in the lambda calculus, especially the Y and Z combinators. Somewhat unrelatedly, I'd also like to understand domain theory and the Knaster-Tarski Theorem.
