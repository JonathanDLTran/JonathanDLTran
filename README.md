### Hi there 👋, I'm Jonathan!

<!-- 
I'm interested in programming languages, particularly regarding techniques, methods, and tools to make it easier for people to program, and to program correctly. I enjoy work related to type systems, static analysis techniques, and compiler optimizations. I am currently studying auto-vectorization techniques, and am curious about search techniques to improve vectorization performance.
