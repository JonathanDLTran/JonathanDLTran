### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Jonathan!

 - ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a toy compiler that targets RISC-V. 
 - ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m trying to gain a deeper understanding about continuation passing style, while also trying to convert the core of the scheme language to CPS. Hopefully I can also implement call/cc.
 - ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the basics of formal verification by working through Volume I of Software Foundations.
